What is HTTPS?
HTTPS is a secure way to send data between a web server and a web browser. It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. it is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary method used to send data between a browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particulary important when users transmit sensitive data such as logging into a bank account, email service or health insurance provider. Any website, especially those thaat require login details, should make use of HTTPS. Web browsers such as Google Chrome take HTTPS seriously.

HTTPS METHODS
The GET Method: Get is used to request data from a specified resource. It is one of the most common method of HTTP methods. Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a Get request:
/test/demo_form.php?
name1=value1&name2=value2
The Post Method: POST is used to send data to a server to create /update a resource. It is one of the most common methods of HTTP. The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request:
POST/test/demo_form.php
HTTPS/1.1
Favoured.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
The PUT Method:PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The difference between POST and PUT are idempotent.
The Head Method: HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body
The DELETE Method: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
The PATCH Method: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
The OPTIONS Method: The OPTIONS method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with the requested resource
Te CONNECT Method: The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with the requested resource.
The TRACE Method: The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that tests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).
